### About me

I am a passionate and driven NLP/AI Developer with a strong background in linguistics and computer science, **currently seeking to transition into data analysis/software design projects within the automotive or motorcycle industry**. I have experience working with Python and various tools, and I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges!
