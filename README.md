ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MokipoCode

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data, NLP and AI.

Looking first to:
- Fine-tune a BERT model dedicated to NER to reflect my previous work experience
- Resume training on data manipulation and analysis (with a NLP specification)
- bonus: redo my master thesis with a lot more knowledge than in 2022 [link https://www.cairn.info/revue-langages-2014-3-page-3.htm#s2n6 3.2]

Put influences: Mistral, Teknium1 https://github.com/sponsors/teknium1, nous research.com, Lecun
