👋 Hi, I’m @MokipoCode

👀 I’m interested in Data, NLP and AI.

👨‍💻 Worked 2022-2023 as a Data Scientist in TotalEnergies (Pau, France), I'm currently not occupying a coding job so I've created this hub to have fun in my free time. 

Looking first to:
- Complete/rework my master thesis learning from my mistakes and my experience [here](https://github.com/MokipoCode/cohab_coref_resolco) [ongoing]
- Use CoLATeP corpus for NLP purposes
- Fine-tune a BERT model dedicated to NER to reflect my previous work experience
- Resume training on data manipulation and analysis (with a NLP specification)

Influences (without particular order) from last year:
- [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/fr/)
- Teknium1, Cofounder @NousResearch [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Teknium1) / [Github](https://github.com/sponsors/teknium1)
- [NousResearch](https://nousresearch.com/)
- Yann LeCun, Chief AI Scientist at Meta [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ylecun)
